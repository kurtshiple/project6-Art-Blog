# project6-Art-Blog
This is a project dedicated to creating a unique and eye catching Content Management System (CMS) for my Moms artwork. A content management system is a dynamic software application that can be used to manage the creation and modification of digital content. The project uses MySQL as a database and PHP PDO to interact with it as well as HTML to display it. It provides an administrative panel that allows the owner of the site to update, modify, and delete posts. It also comes with a user login system to keep those privilages private.
